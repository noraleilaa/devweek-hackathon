# Attune

## The making of:
What inspired us to create our web app was not only the typingdna API itself, but also the shared interest among our teammates in how cognition is interlinked with emotion.
	The concept of being able to analyze a user's mood by the way a user is typing intrigued our group members. This function is featured in typingdna’s experimental products, and adds so much potential to the existing breadth of knowledge that surrounds typingdna. Our webapp Attune analyzes a user's mood using the existing open-source API for Parallel Dot’s, and combines it with Spotify’s API. What resulted is an intuitive text analyzer that recommends what music to listen to based on your mood.
	Attune’s simple UserFlow begins with the user being prompted to login via Spotify. This process is started by pressing the simple button that initiates the user being taken to Spotify’s seamless login.The login process then leads to a screen where you can enter a short journal entry describing how you feel, this is when Parallel Dot’s API synthesizes the text tells you your mood, and the app will recommend a song for you. It’s easy and intuitive.
	Try it out for yourself!
